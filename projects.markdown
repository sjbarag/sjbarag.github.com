<h4>Well, uh, you see...</h4>
I haven't added pages for my projects yet.  Most of them are available [on
GitHub](http://github.com/sjbarag), but here's a short list of links their
source:

* [Textspansion](http://github.com/1393designs/textspansion) - Text expansion for Android
* [Notman](http://github.com/sjbarag/statnot) - A Linux D-Bus notification manager
