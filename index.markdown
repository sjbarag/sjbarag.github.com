**Hiya!**  I'm Sean, a senior at [Drexel University](http://drexel.edu), double
majoring in Electronics Engineering and Computer Engineering.  I spend a lot of
my free time programming, tinkering with some circuit or another, or tweaking
my [Linux Config](github.com/sjbarag/dotfiles).  I'm also have a small
collection of fountain pens.
